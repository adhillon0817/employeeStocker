# 12 SQL: Employee Stocker

# GitHub Repo:
https://github.com/adhillon0817/employeeStocker 

## Purpose
The purpose of the project was to create a database of employees. The user can be prompted with multiple questions such as what role they would like to add, who the new employee is, assign the employee a manager and employee_id. All of these can be done through this set up. You can also edit the employee to change their role or salary. 

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```
In order to run this you must first run the basic command to connect to MySQL and then connect to both severs, SCHEMA.SQL and SEEDS.SQL. They are both located in the db folder so make sure you route to that! Once you are connected go back to the root terminal and run node index.js!
